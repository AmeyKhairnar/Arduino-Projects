Steps To Communicate Using HC-05 Module:

1)Connect the HC-05 Module to Arduino. Note that the RXD Pin of HC-05 shouldn't be given more than 3.3V. Apply a Potential Divider Circuit to do so.
2)Connect the LED to Arduino.
3)Upload the code and turn on the power supplies.
4)Download a BT Terminal App from Play Store and pair up your mobile and HC-05.
